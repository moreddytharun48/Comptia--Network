### .Network Components

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
| Hubs |  Connects the device like client and server over a LAN
| Proxy |  is an intermediate between user's device and internet
| Client | device the users acess the network with
| Router| used to connect different networks together |
| Firewalls| security barrier between internal and external network |
| Switches| better version of hub more bandwidth utiization
| Servers| resource provider to the network
|Wireless access points| allow wireless devices to connect to a wired network
|Load Balancers|device or software that distribute network across multiple servers
|Ips,Ids| ids[detects unauthorized access] ips [detects and prevents]


###  .Network Resorces
|Client server model  | peer to peer model  |
| ----- | ------ |
|Utilizes a dedicated server to provide access to n/w resources| Machines can share resources together directly
|Administration and backup easy | difficult

### .Network geography
|||
| ----- | ------ |
|Personal Area Network(PAN)| Smallest type of wired or wireless network cover usually distance of 10 feets
|Local Area Netwok(LAN)| Connects components in a limited distance about 100 mts
|Campus Area Network(CAN)|a bilding centric LAN that spread across the numerpus buildings in certain area
|Metro Politan Area Network(MAN)| connects loaction that are scatterd across the city [ex: colege has 6 branches in city and each connected with different LAN and all the LAN's are connected to MAN 
|Wired Area Network| Connects geographically internal network

### .Wired Network Topology
  Arrangements of different elements like links,nodes,client and server that make up a computer network is a network Topology
  |||
  | ----- | ---- |
  |Point to Point| Direct connections between two devices
  |Bus|All devices connected to a single central cable
  |Ring|network config where ecah device is connected to two or more devices
  |Mesh|point to point connection between every sinle device on the network [full mesh,partial mesh]
  |Star|Each node is connected to a centralized connection point
  |Hub and Spoke|Variation of star topology central node(hub) is connected to multiple nodes (spokes)
  ### . Wireless Network Topology
  |||
  | ---- | ---- |
  |Infrastructure mode| uses wireless access point as a centralized point
  |AD-hoc| decentralized wireless network creates peer to peer and does nit require any access point
  |Wireless Mesh| 2 or 3 technologies combined to create a wireless n/w topolgy and it is the interconnection of different types of nodes,radio and devices
  ### . Data Center Topology
| | | 
| ---- | ---- |
|Three-tired hirearchy|Core  -  distributed/aggregation  -  Access .     [Core : biggest,fastest,expensive routers] [Distribution : Under the core layer . provide boundary definations ] [Acess : Under distribution layer]
|Collapsed core| network architecture where core and distributed layers are merged into single layer
|Spine and Leaf architecture|focuses on the communication within the data center itself. SPINE : connects switches in full mesh topology.LEAF: consists of all the access of switches 
|Traffic Flows| NORTH{leaving}-SOUTH{Entering}  [traffic that enters or leaves the data center from a system]  ,  EAST-WEST  [data flow within the data center]
